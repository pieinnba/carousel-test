> 2. Clicking prev/next buttons should scroll exactly one image left/right
> 3. Desktop version: number of visible images should vary to fit the viewport width
> 4. Mobile version: show one full-width image
> 5. Make carousel a separate component with the list of images as a prop
> 6. Each image can be selected (mark it visually). List of selected image urls should be placed below the carousel
> 7. **Extra:** Add transitions and/or animations for the carousel
> 8. **Extra:** Add transitions and/or animations for the list of selected images

> ### Tools
> 
> The implementation must be done in JavaScript or TypeScript. Feel free to use frameworks such as Vue.
> 
> **DO NOT USE any 3rd party libs for the Carousel itself!**
